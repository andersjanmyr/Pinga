## Pinga

Pinga is a simple application for pinging URLs. It is used to make sure
that certain hosts are awake. It sends emails when the server does not
respond with OK(200).

Currently everything in it is hard-coded, but in the future...

### Todo

* Runtime adding and modification of URLs.
* Admin scheduling
* Log to database
